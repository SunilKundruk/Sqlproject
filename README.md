# Problem Statement
## In todayâ€™s digital economy, e-commerce businesses generate vast amounts of transactional data, including customer orders, payments, and seller performance. Analyzing this data efficiently is crucial for understanding customer behavior, revenue trends, product performance, and operational efficiency. However, due to the high volume of data and complex relationships between tables, it becomes challenging to extract meaningful insights manually.
### This project aims to solve these challenges by using SQL queries to analyze various aspects of an e-commerce business, such as sales trends, customer retention, churn analysis, seller performance, and product demand forecasting.

# Project Description
## This project involves performing advanced SQL-based analysis on an e-commerce dataset containing orders, payments, customers, and sellers. The dataset is structured across multiple relational tables, making it ideal for SQL-based querying and insights generation.
### The project includes 24 well-structured SQL queries designed to extract meaningful insights, ranging from basic exploratory analysis (e.g., identifying unique customer locations) to complex analytical queries ### (e.g., calculating customer lifetime value and revenue growth trends).

# Key Features of the Project:
## âœ… Revenue & Sales Analysis â†’ Identifies total sales per category, monthly revenue trends, and revenue growth rates.
## âœ… Customer Behavior Analysis â†’ Evaluates customer retention, churn impact, and spending patterns.
## âœ… Product Performance Analysis â†’ Finds the most frequently bought-together products and those with high cancellation rates.
## âœ… Seller Performance Analysis â†’ Ranks sellers based on revenue and delivery speed.
## âœ… Risk Assessment â†’ Examines churn risk based on credit scores and product usage behavior.
## The SQL queries used in this project include joins, aggregations, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and ranking functions, ensuring efficient data retrieval and insightful analysis.

# Technologies Used:
### SQL (Structured Query Language) for data querying and analysis
### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
### Data Aggregation & Window Functions for ranking and trend analysis
### Common Table Expressions (CTEs) & Joins for advanced query structuring
# Use Cases & Business Impact
### ðŸ“Š Business Growth Monitoring â†’ Helps e-commerce platforms track sales and revenue trends.
### ðŸ“¦ Product Optimization â†’ Identifies best-selling products and those leading to cancellations.
### ðŸ’° Customer Retention Strategies â†’ Analyzes churned customers and their purchasing patterns.
### ðŸ“ˆ Financial Risk Assessment â†’ Examines revenue loss and customer credit score behavior.

# This project provides real-world insights that businesses can use to optimize marketing, sales, and customer engagement strategies.
